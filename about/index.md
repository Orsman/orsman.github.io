Working on the internet creating digital experiences isn't something I’ve done my whole life nor dreamed about when I was a kid...

Not knowing what to do with my life in my early twenties lead me in to the university and Economics. Even if it wasn’t something I really wanted to do, it at least didn’t feel like wasted time. Economics is always good to know right? But at the end of studies I realised this was not the direction I wanted (nor was ready) to take in my life. Having a regular day job and just working through my life, was not appealing. My biggest concern was that there were so many things I wanted to do in my life and so little time. Time that I could waste doing something “ok”.

So I quit.

To find out what I should do next I put on my favorite music and started writing EVERYTHING I wanted to do in my life. No matter how crazy it was or impossible it seemed.

Out of this list I could see a pattern. Being able to work from anywhere, not having a strict schedule, inspire people go for what they want, and striving to be the best possible version of myself. This set me of on a 3 year long self discovery journey that involved a lot of traveling, challenging beliefs and adventures.

When I got back from that big trip I wanted to travel more. For a couple of years. But didn’t have the money to do that. So I needed a job that made it possible to work remotely. After telling this to a friend he introduced me to web development. I started on some online code schools and got hooked. I loved it and the freedom it gave me. Coded on all my free time and later that year I made the decision to quit my part time jobs and start freelancing.

Today I’m working full time with developing digital products. I feel very privileged to be able to work with my hobby.

### My life philosophy

I’m very passionated about self-improvement. We only have a short period of time to live and I really want to maximise all my experiences and reaching my potential. Still have that list from the end of my uni-life. Some have been done and a few more items have been added.

Most of the items on the list is related to me just being better at things. Better at living life. My intentions is to share what I’ve done and learned along the way.
